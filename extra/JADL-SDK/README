The following provide brief instructions for building the
JADL-SDK module.

The first thing you will need to do is build the java
source code and binary library.

see build.sh for an example build script

After the library is built and installed you will need to modify
the primary API java class which can be found in your build 
directory named 

java/src/com/vnetpublishing/swig/adl/jadl_sdk.java


Current versions of clojure have a bug which makes loading
IDL libraries at runtime nearly impossible. To get around this
bug you will need to perform the following code modification.

In the top of the java class add the following code...

static {
   try {
      System.loadLibrary("jadlsdk");
   } catch (Throwable t) {
   }
}

Once your java sources are prepared you will need to compile all of
the java sources and build them into a jar. Once the jar is built
it will need to be named jadl-sdk-1.0.jar and stored in the project
folder (extra/JADL-SDK/jadl-sdk-1.0.jar).
